## How to Run

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to backend

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp ../.env.example .env

## Example Usage

### Process an email

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/orchestrator/process" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "raw_text": "I had my MRI at Dr. Smith office yesterday. Bill was $2,500. Can we schedule a meeting to discuss?",
    "source_type": "email",
    "case_id": "CASE-2024-001"
  }'
```

**Response includes:**
- Normalized text

2. **Privacy First**: Automatic PII/PHI detection and labeling
3. **Messy Input Handling**: Designed for real-world, unstructured data
4. **Intelligent Routing**: Tasks go to the most qualified specialist
5. **Transparency**: Every decision includes reasoning and confidence scores
6. **Proper Coding Practices**:
   - Type hints throughout
   - Pydantic models for validation
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Extensive test coverage
   - Clean code structure
   - Environment-based configuration
