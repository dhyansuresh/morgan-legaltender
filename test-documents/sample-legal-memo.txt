LEGAL MEMORANDUM

TO: Senior Partner
FROM: Associate Attorney
DATE: October 26, 2024
RE: Smith v. Jones - Negligence Case Analysis

FACTS:
Our client, John Smith, was involved in a motor vehicle accident on September 15, 2024, at the intersection of Main Street and Oak Avenue. The defendant, Mary Jones, allegedly ran a red light and collided with our client's vehicle.

Client sustained the following injuries:
- Whiplash and neck strain
- Lower back pain
- Herniated disc at L4-L5
- Emotional distress

Medical treatment includes:
- Emergency room visit at General Hospital ($5,200)
- MRI scan ($1,800)
- Physical therapy (ongoing, 12 sessions to date)
- Pain management consultation with Dr. Robert Williams

LEGAL ISSUES:
1. Establishing negligence - defendant's breach of duty by running red light
2. Causation - linking defendant's actions to client's injuries
3. Damages - quantifying economic and non-economic losses
4. Comparative negligence - defendant claims our client was speeding

ANALYSIS:
Under state law, to prove negligence we must establish:
(a) Duty of care - all drivers owe duty to follow traffic laws
(b) Breach - running red light constitutes clear breach
(c) Causation - witness testimony confirms defendant's light was red
(d) Damages - medical records document injuries

Supporting evidence:
- Traffic camera footage showing red light violation
- Police report citing defendant for traffic violation
- Three eyewitness statements corroborating our version
- Medical records from Dr. Williams and General Hospital

RECOMMENDATION:
We should proceed with the negligence claim. The evidence is strong, particularly the traffic camera footage and police report. We need to:

1. Obtain complete medical records from all providers
2. Secure expert testimony from accident reconstruction specialist
3. Request settlement demand of $250,000 (medical bills + pain/suffering)
4. Prepare for potential comparative negligence defense

NEXT STEPS:
- Draft demand letter to defendant's insurance carrier
- Schedule deposition of defendant
- Retain medical expert to review client's prognosis
- File complaint if settlement negotiations fail

Please advise on how you would like to proceed.
